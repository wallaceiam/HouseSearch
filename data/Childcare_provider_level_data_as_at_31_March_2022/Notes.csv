Notes
"An explanation about main uses of this data, further contextual information and the arrangements for quality assurance is provided in the methodology and quality report, which accompanies this release.
The methodology and quality report also provides information on the strengths and limitations of the statistics. "
Education inspection framework (EIF)
"On 1 September 2019, we began inspecting under the EIF. The EIF helps to support consistency across inspections of early years and childcare providers, maintained schools, academies, non-association independent schools, and further education and skills providers in England. We evaluate the overall quality and standards of the early years provision in line with the principles and requirements of the early years foundation stage statutory framework. Inspectors judge the overall effectiveness of the early years provision, taking into account 4 judgements:
•  quality of education
•  behaviour and attitudes
•  personal development
•  effectiveness of leadership and management
We were required to inspect all providers that were on the EYR on 1 August 2016 at least once by 31 July 2020. We will normally inspect providers that have registered after this date within 30 months of registration. However, due to the impact of COVID-19, we paused our routine inspections in mid-March 2020. We started these again in May 2021 and prioritised providers:
•  that had been judged less than good at their last inspection
•  that had registered recently and that had not been previously inspected
•  whose first inspection was overdue
•  that had not inspected in the last inspection cycle due to the pause in routine inspection"
Common inspection Framework
"Between 1 September 2015 and 31 August 2019, we carried out inspections under the common inspection framework. Inspectors judged the overall effectiveness of the early years provision, taking into account the following additional judgements:
• quality of teaching, learning and assessment
• personal development, behaviour and welfare
• effectiveness of leadership and management
• outcomes for children.
These additional judgements will not be captured in the most recent inspection judgement fields, with the exception of 'effectiveness of leadership and management'. This is due to these fields being replaced with the EIF key judgements."
Glossary
Childcare providers
"Childcare providers care for at least one individual child for a total of more than 2 hours in any one day. This is not necessarily a continuous period. They must register on the CCR to care for children under the age of 8, although there may be some exceptions to this. They can register on the VCR to care for older children."
Childcare providers on domestic and non-domestic premises
"If 4 or more people look after children at any one time in someone’s home, they are providing childcare on domestic premises, not childminding. 

Childcare providers on non-domestic premises are people or organisations providing care for individual children in premises that are not someone’s home. These premises can range from converted houses to purpose-built nurseries."
Childcare Register (CR)
"The CR is for providers that care for children from birth to 18 years. It has 2 parts: 

• Compulsory Childcare Register (CCR) – for providers caring for children from 1 September after the child's fifth birthday up until their eighth birthday
• Voluntary Childcare Register (VCR) – for providers for whom registration is not compulsory, for example nannies, or providers that care for children aged 8 and over

Providers that are registered on either part of the Childcare Register do not need to submit their places information to Ofsted.

For providers registered on the Childcare Register, Ofsted inspects a sample of 10% of active providers per year."
Childminders
"A childminder is a person who is registered to look after one or more children, to whom they are not related, for reward. Childminders work on domestic premises alongside no more than 2 other childminders or assistants. They must register if they care for children under the age of 8 and can choose to register if they care for older children. They care for:

• children on domestic premises that are not usually the home of one of the children unless they care for children from more than 2 families, wholly or mainly in the homes of the families
• at least one individual child for a total of more than 2 hours in any day (not necessarily a continuous period)"
Childminder agencies 
"Childminder agencies were introduced in September 2014 as an alternative registration option for childminders. Childminders who register with an agency no longer need to register or be inspected by Ofsted, although the agency itself will receive an inspection. 

Childminder agencies are only eligible for inspection by Ofsted when they have childminders on roll. Childminder agencies have the responsibility of inspecting the childminders who are registered with them."
Early years foundation stage (EYFS)
"The EYFS is the statutory framework for the early education and care of children from birth to 31 August following their fifth birthday.
"
Early Years Register (EYR)
"The EYR is for providers that care for children in the early years age group, from birth to 31 August following their fifth birthday. Registration is compulsory for these providers and they must meet the requirements of the EYFS.
"
Home childcarers
"Home childcarers are usually nannies who care for children of any age up to their 18th birthday wholly or mainly in the child’s own home, and care for children from no more than 2 families. They are not required to register with Ofsted, though they may choose to do so on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register."
Inspection windows
"Until recently, we inspected childcare providers on a 4-year inspection cycle. The most recent inspection cycle ran from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2020. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus), we paused our routine inspections in mid-March 2020.
As we resume full EYR inspections from May 2021, we will no longer be inspecting providers on a 4-year cycle. All early years providers will have their own inspection window based on the date and judgement of their last inspection. We will look to inspect all providers within a 6-year window. However, we will continue to re-inspect providers judged ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’ within 12 and 6 months respectively. We will still aim to inspect all new childcare providers within 30 months of their registration date."
Joiners and leavers
"Joiners are childcare providers that have registered with Ofsted during this reporting period. Most of these are new registrations, but Tables 3 and 4 and Chart 1 within the ‘Childcare providers and inspections charts and tables’ document also include providers with re-activated registrations and those that have changed provider type or register. At local authority or regional level, this may also include providers that have relocated into a new geographical area.

Leavers are mostly childcare providers that have left Ofsted during the reporting period. Most of these are resignations, but some are also providers that have had their registration cancelled or have changed provider type or register. At local authority or regional level, this may also include providers that have relocated out of a geographical area."
No children on roll (NCOR)
"If there are no children present on the day of the provider's inspection, they receive an NCOR inspection. The inspector will make a judgement on the ‘overall quality and standards of the early years provision’, with 3 possible outcomes:

• met
• not met – actions
• not met – enforcement action"
Registered places
"Registered places are the number of children that may attend the provision at any one time. Registered places are not the number of places occupied, nor the number of children who may benefit from receiving places through providers offering sessions at different times of the day. Place numbers are only collected for providers on the EYR. Provider type averages are used to estimate the number of places for a very small number of providers whose place numbers are not available at the time of the analysis. There may also be small discrepancies in totals due to rounding."
Out-of-school day care
"Providers (including childminders) registered on the EYR but that only provide care exclusively for children at the beginning and end of the school day or in holiday periods do not need to meet the learning and development requirements of the EYFS. The inspector will make a judgement only on the ‘overall effectiveness: quality and standards of the early years provision’ with 3 possible outcomes:

• met
• not met – with actions
• not met – with enforcement"
